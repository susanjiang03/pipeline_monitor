Welcome to Pipeline Monitor's documentation!
============================================

This is a Django project based on two apps, News and Pmonitor.
The main objective of this project is to provide visualization of a process through its many stages.

Here the process is defined by our *News* app, which is a news aggregator.
Our second app, *Pmonitor*, collects a series of tasks generated by the *News* app displays them through a D3.js image (pipeline looking).

To start using the app, clone a copy, install the :doc:`requirements`
and spin up the the Django development server, 'python manage.py runserver'
